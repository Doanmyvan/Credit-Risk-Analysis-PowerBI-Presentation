# 💳 Credit Risk Analysis – Loan Default Insights (Power BI & PowerPoint)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes loan default risk among applicants using historical borrower data. By leveraging Power BI for data modeling and visualization, the analysis identifies high-risk borrowers, helping financial institutions make data-driven credit decisions and minimize potential losses.

Power BI was used to calculate key metrics and generate interactive dashboards, while findings were presented in PowerPoint for executive storytelling.

## 🚀 Analytical Strategy
Break down borrowers by risk factors (income, debt-to-income ratio, credit history, past defaults) to identify patterns and high-risk segments. Use interactive dashboards to explore trends and insights.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Assess the risk of loan default across applicants.
- Identify key factors driving credit risk.
- Provide actionable insights for lending decisions.
- Enable risk-based prioritization for loan approvals.

## 📊 Key Insights

Top Risk Drivers:
- Short credit history
- High debt-to-income ratio
- Low income-to-loan ratio
- Past loan defaults

Trend Observations: Borrower defaults are concentrated in certain income brackets and loan types.

Business Impact: Targeted monitoring and intervention could reduce potential default losses by X%.
